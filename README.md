# DECO2017-Web-prototype
History:
Brunch (DECO2017-Web-prototype)

This file contains the work done in May and the work can be divided into 5 sections： 1st section: Completion of the top navigation bar of the page, as well as the player in the home page, the dictionary and the stopwatch pop-up floating window. 2nd Section: The hourglass graphic of the tomato clock in the navigation bar. 3rd Section: Working on the class page and functions. 4th Section: Kanban board, function of add and delete. Demostration of Kanban board basically completed. 5th Section: Contact Us page. After the page was completed, I found problems with some parts of the page, the size of the icons and the change of the text. Next, trying to fix the problems and planning to join workshop on 26th.

Brunch (DECO2017_A5_31/05_editing)

Based on 26th Drew's feedback, I reduced the quality of the images to make the site's homepage load faster. Also I changed the name of the page and the name of the jump page as well as resizing the icons on the navigation bar to make it look more coherent.

Brunch (01/06-edit)

Based on the feedback, I split the Json and CSS code into multiple files corresponding to separate interfaces.

26/05 Workshop 2-3 PM:
Drew examined my code as well as the site and made his point.
1. The site uses too much image quality, which causes the loading speed to become slower by.
2. There is only one CSS and JSON code file, which is difficult to check, so it is recommended to create a separate code for a separate page.
3. The size of the navigation bar icon is not consistent.
4. Dictionary function, it is recommended to use external links.
5. The title of the page is not changed.


Final work:

The problems that Drew mentions are fixed, and the dictionary and music player are updated. Personally, it is hard for me to choose a song or a type of music during working time, then I change it to radio and users don’t need to make decisios.
